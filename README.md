This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app) using Trpc.

## Getting Started

First, run the install and then fire up the local server:

```bash
npm install
npm run serve

# or
yarn install
yarn serve

# or
pnpm install
pnpm serve
```

### Trpc And NextJS

Its a sample app exploring Trpc with NextJs. In order to run the subscription we had to write our own server. All server code is under `server` folder.
